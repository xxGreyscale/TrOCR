<p>Aleo is a contemporary typeface designed by Alessio Laiso as the slab serif companion to the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato">Lato</a> font by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic. Aleo has semi-rounded details and a sleek structure, giving it a strong personality while still keeping readability high.</p>

<p>The June 2023 update expanded the family from 6 style to 18 and became variable. It offers also a better language support (Pan African and Vietnamese added), and the design and spacing have been improved.</p>
