    Climate Crisis, is a variable font designed to help visualise the urgency of climate change, designed for Helsingin Sanomat, the largest Nordic newspaper. The typefaceâ€™s weight responds to the levels of Arctic sea ice from 1979 to 2019 and predictions for 2050, based on data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

<h3>Show your type melting over time like a glacier with Climate Crisis and its Year axis</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the recent article about the Tilt family, Google Fonts is adding a bunch of new expressive variable fonts and axes to the library. Check out the latest release, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Climate+Crisis">Climate Crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Climate Crisis, with its new variable axis called Year, was commissioned by the Nordic newspaper "<a href="https://www.hs.fi/">Helsingin Sanomat</a>" to use in its own editorial and marketing. It visualizes the urgency of climate change by appearing to degrade over time, like each character is a glacier melting away. More than just a metaphor, the font reflects actual data from the <a href="https://nsidc.org/home">National Snow and Ice Data Center</a> to represent the levels of Arctic sea ice from 1979 to 2019. Satellite measuring began in 1979. Predictive data from <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) is used to visualize the ice melting through 2050.</p>
<p>The typeface's designers, Daniel Coull and Eino Korkala included eight <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/masters">masters</a> for the Year axis. (When type designers create a variable font, they need to embed masters at each extreme end of a variable axis, but often they embed multiple masters along the axis in order to give the in-between <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/instance">instances</a> more finesse.) The heaviest weight represents the Arctic sea ice in 1979. The lightest weight represents the IPCC's 2050 forecast, when only 30% of the ice will remain.</p>
