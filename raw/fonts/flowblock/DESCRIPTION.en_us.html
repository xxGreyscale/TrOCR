    Flow is a font family built for abstracting content and code for design mockups, wireframing, presentations, and websites. It's not perfect, but neither are your wireframes. Flow has sub-pixels, artifacts, overlaps and other imperfections.

<p>
    Flow comes in three styles: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Flow+Circular">Circular</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Flow+Rounded">Rounded</a> and Block.
