    Lugrasimo is a DocRepair font, intended to improve compliance with the ISO/IEC
    29500 standard by providing fallback for Lucida Calligraphy that minimizes text reflow in Office Open
    XML documents. Lugrasimo is based on Fondamento, a typeface in calligraphic
    lettering style based on the traditional Foundational Hand, a basic teaching
    style created by Edward Johnston in the early 20th century. The letterforms
    are clear and cleanly legible, basic and formal.
