    Matemasie is an ultra-bold display typeface characterized by rounded edges and a distinctive feature where the shapes
    widen towards the top. It draws inspiration from the Adinkra symbol "Mate Masie," meaning "what I hear, I keep." This 
    symbolizes interconnected ears, emphasizing the importance of listening and communication in oral traditions and cultures.
