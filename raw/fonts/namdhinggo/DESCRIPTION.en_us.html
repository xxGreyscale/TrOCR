<p>This project provides a libre and open font family for the Limbu script of Nepal. According to traditional histories the Limbu script was developed by King Sirijonga in the 9th Century. It then fell out of use before being reintroduced in the 18th century by Teongsi Sirijonga (1704-1741) whom many felt to be the reincarnation of the first Sirijonga. The modern Sirijonga was apparently martyred in 1741 for the sake of this script by lamas in Sikkim. The script was named 'Sirijonga' in his honour by the Limbu scholar Iman Singh Chemjong.</p>
