    Signika variable font is a sans-serif with a gentle character, developed for wayfinding, signage, and other media where clarity of information is required.
    It has a low contrast and tall x-height to improve readability of texts in small sizes as well as in large distances from the reader.
    Being a typical signage typeface it is inspired by typefaces such as Ronnia, Meta, and Tahoma.

    The typeface comes with a wide character set supporting Western European languages, Polish, and Czech.
    The figures are designed as tabular.

    In July 2023, a GRAD axis is added to solve the optical effects of negative text setting (dark color text on light background).
