    <a href="https://www.sil.org/">SIL International</a> recently released three typefaces for lesser-served <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/script_writing_system">writing systems</a> (Tai Viet, Yi, Lepcha) used in Asia. 
    SIL has also created <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Andika">Andika</a>, which is specially designed to maximize legibility for new readers.

<h3>SIL and lesser-served languages</h3>
<p>
    SIL International has a team of type designers who specialize in creating typefaces for lesser-served or non-dominant language communities. These are communities that exist alongside larger, more prominent language communities such as Chinese, English, or Arabic. 
    These relatively smaller communities may have their own script, or they may have sounds in their language that are not represented in the script used by the majority language. 
    Some non-dominant languages are endangered. According to UNESCO, <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/international-congress-endangered-languages-risk-begins-advance-unescos-high-level-event">about 40% of the estimated 7,000 languages are at risk of extinction.</a>
</p>
<p>Without typefaces, these language communities can't survive online.</p>
