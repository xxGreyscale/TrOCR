<p>Tektur is a constructed typeface featuring octagonal outlines and rectangular counters. This rudimentary principle is applied where rounds are typically found, but most of the diagonals are left intact which helps preserve good readability and a familiar stance. The x-height is set high and ascenders are aligned with the cap height allowing for compact typesetting.</p>
