    Victor Mono is a monospaced font with optional semi-connected cursive italics and programming symbol ligatures. The typeface is slender, crisp and narrow, with a large x-height and clear punctuation, making it legible and ideal for code.
</p>

<p>The typeface was created to meet specific requirements for code and programming:
    <ul>
        <li>narrow enough to fit a lot of text</li>
        <li>wide enough to be scannable</li>
        <li>strict, geometric and readable regular style</li>
        <li>more friendly and flowing italics</li>
        <li>programming symbol ligatures</li>
    </ul>
